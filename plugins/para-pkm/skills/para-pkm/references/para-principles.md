# PARA Method Principles

The PARA Method is a universal system for organizing digital information, created by Tiago Forte of Forte Labs.

## The Four Categories

### Projects
**Definition**: A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.

**Examples:**
- Complete web design project
- Finish manuscript for new book
- Plan surprise birthday party
- Execute Q3 marketing campaign
- Launch product by December

**Key characteristics:**
- Has a clear end date or completion state
- Multiple tasks required
- Specific deliverable or outcome
- When complete, moves to Archives

### Areas
**Definition**: A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.

**Examples:**
- Health & fitness
- Finances
- Professional development
- Home maintenance
- Relationships
- Business operations (for consultancies)
- Product development (ongoing R&D)

**Key characteristics:**
- No end date
- Ongoing responsibility
- Standard to maintain (not a goal to achieve)
- Never "completed", only abandoned

### Resources
**Definition**: A topic or theme of ongoing interest.

**Examples:**
- Coding standards
- Design patterns
- Coffee brewing techniques
- Graphic design inspiration
- Marketing frameworks
- Library preferences
- Platform configurations

**Key characteristics:**
- Reference material
- May be useful in the future
- No actionable component right now
- Organized by topic

### Archives
**Definition**: Inactive items from the other three categories.

**Examples:**
- Completed projects
- Areas no longer maintained
- Resources no longer relevant

**Key characteristics:**
- Previously in Projects, Areas, or Resources
- No longer actively used
- Kept for reference or documentation
- Can be reactivated if needed

## Core Principles

### 1. Organize by Actionability
PARA is organized by **how actionable** something is, not by topic or type:
- Projects = most actionable (deadline-driven)
- Areas = regular maintenance
- Resources = reference material
- Archives = inactive

### 2. Start with Projects
Most people overthink organization. Start by asking: "What projects am I committed to right now?"

Put everything else in Resources temporarily. Over time, patterns will emerge for Areas.

### 3. One Home Per Item
Each piece of information should have one primary home. Avoid duplicating content across categories.

Use links or references to connect related content across PARA categories.

### 4. Move Between Categories
Items naturally move through PARA over their lifecycle:

**Common flows:**
- Resources → Projects (reference material becomes active work)
- Projects → Archives (project completes)
- Areas → Archives (responsibility ends)
- Projects → Areas (time-bound goal becomes ongoing)

### 5. Keep It Simple
PARA works best with minimal subcategorization:
- Projects: Usually just `active/` and maybe `stories/` or `templates/`
- Areas: Organize by life domain or responsibility
- Resources: Organize by topic
- Archives: Often just a flat list with dates

## PARA vs Other Systems

### PARA vs Zettelkasten
- **PARA**: Action-oriented containers (folders)
- **Zettelkasten**: Connection-oriented atomic notes (links)
- **Combined**: Use PARA for resources and workflows, Zettelkasten for ideas within them

### PARA vs GTD (Getting Things Done)
- **GTD**: Task and context-based (Next Actions, Someday/Maybe, Waiting For)
- **PARA**: Project and area-based (what are you working on?)
- **Relationship**: PARA complements GTD as the organizational layer above tasks

### PARA vs Folders by Topic
- **Topic folders**: Organized by subject (Work, Personal, Finance, etc.)
- **PARA**: Organized by actionability (what needs attention now?)
- **Benefit**: PARA surfaces what's relevant, not just what's related

## Common Questions

### "Is this a Project or an Area?"
Ask: **Does it have an end state?**
- If yes → Project
- If no → Area

Examples:
- "Get promoted to Senior Engineer" = Project (has end state)
- "Career development" = Area (ongoing responsibility)

### "Should I create subcategories in Projects/Areas/Resources?"
**Projects**: Usually keep flat or just `active/` vs `templates/` or `stories/`
**Areas**: Yes, subcategorize by domain (health, finance, business, etc.)
**Resources**: Yes, subcategorize by topic (coding, design, research, etc.)

### "What if something fits multiple categories?"
Choose the **most actionable** category:
1. Is it part of an active project? → Projects
2. Is it an ongoing responsibility? → Areas
3. Is it reference material? → Resources
4. Is it inactive? → Archives

Link between categories if needed, but keep one primary home.

### "How do I handle client work?"
Two approaches:
1. **Client as Project**: Each client engagement in `projects/active/client-name.md`
2. **Client as Area**: Consultancy in `areas/consulting/` with client sub-folders

Choose based on your work:
- Fixed engagements with end dates → Projects
- Ongoing relationships/retainers → Areas

Can also use **both**: Technical work in Projects, relationship/ops in Areas.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Inbox Folder
PARA doesn't need an inbox. Capture directly into the appropriate category:
- Unsure? Put in Resources temporarily
- Quick capture? Add to relevant project immediately

### ❌ Deep Nesting
Keep hierarchy shallow (max 2-3 levels):
- Good: `areas/business/operations/invoicing.md`
- Bad: `areas/business/operations/financial/accounting/invoicing/2025/q1.md`

### ❌ Topic-Based Organization
Avoid organizing purely by topic. Organize by action:
- Bad: `work/`, `personal/`, `hobbies/`
- Good: `projects/`, `areas/`, `resources/`

### ❌ Perfectionism
PARA is meant to be flexible. Don't overthink placement:
- Move things between categories as understanding evolves
- "Wrong" location is better than no organization
- Refinement happens naturally over time
